# Irregular repeat-accumulate codes in Rust
This project is an implementation of encoder and decoder for [IRA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeat-accumulate_code) error-correcting codes.<br>
Also implemented is one of the methods for generation of optimal IRA codes presented in [A. Roumy, S. Guemghar, G. Caire and S. Verdu, "Design methods for irregular repeat-accumulate codes,"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1317116).
